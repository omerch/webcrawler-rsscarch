Lauri Ann West Community Center," O’Hara Township, Pennsylvania","The design focused on sustainable design in terms of its energy usage, durability of materials and maintenance costs. The bright colors of the building reflect the positive energy and myriad of activities for children and adults that occur year-long and throughout the building. The new home of the Lauri Ann West Community Center will provide an energy efficient easily maintained gathering place for the whole community."
Golden Triangle Construction," Imperial, Pennsylvania","RSSC designed the new office building as a separate structure from the maintenance shop. The workspaces in the new facility offer all employees access to views and daylight. The new campus has many sustainable features. Energy-efficient lighting and a geothermal heat pump are expected to reduce energy costs by more than 28% when compared to similar facilities. The installation of a water recycling system for the construction equipment cleaning machinery will reduce process water consumption by 95%. New landscaping will eliminate the need for irrigation and ultra-high efficiency water closets, urinals, faucets and showers will reduce potable water usage by more than 20%."
Monroeville Municipal Center/911 & Police Facility," Monroeville, Pennsylvania","Among several considered, the existing property proved to be the most favorable for new development. Our plans included a brand new municipal center with traditional and contemporary design aspects. During construction, it was essential that the Municipality of Monroeville conduct their important business and often life-saving responsibilities in their existing location, just twenty-five feet away from the construction area. With a thoughtful strategy and carefully planned building phases, we worked collaboratively with administrative officials of Monroeville, the contractor and community members to ensure that they could use their older building, uninterrupted, until it’s demolition after relocation of municipal operations to the newly-built Monroeville Municipal Center."

Karndean Designflooring," Export, Pennsylvania","The Mid Atlantic Real Estate Journal featured our design for the innovative efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to heat, cool and light the interior of the building. By designing this new warehouse and on-site production facility with energy-efficiency features and daylighting, we have helped Karndean Designflooring reduce their operational costs, minimize their environmental impact and provide a healthy, comfortable working environment for their employees. The walls, roof, windows and doors were all designed to minimize the transfer of heat. The roof was also designed with a high Solar Reflectance Index (SRI) to reduce the heat load on the building. To minimize electric energy consumption, the new facilities feature light-diffusing, prismatic skylights coupled with dimmable LED light system that reduces the use of artificial lighting and improves color rendition in the production space."
The Firepit Wood Fired Grill," North Huntingdon Township, Pennsylvania","The new entry and addition provide an exciting new look for the building and give it a strong visual prominence in the existing shopping center. Renovations to the existing building provide a large, formal dining area, a private dining room and the wood-fired grill and kitchen. The exposed structure and sensitive use of materials give the bar & dining areas a unique and warm atmosphere."
Baierl Family YMCA – North Hills Branch," Franklin Park, Pennsylvania","Located on a 12-acre site in a residential area that borders a growing commercial district, the project was designed to minimize the visual impact of the building and its related outdoor recreational and parking areas on its neighbors. The two-story mass of the gymnasium is tucked into the hillside on the north side of the site, revealing a low-profile at the second floor level that allows clerestory lighting of the gym around the second-floor track. The other major components radiate outward from the gym, allowing maximum exposure to daylight and views. Low-sloped roofs help to mediate the scale of the elements around the central core of the main lobby."
CleanTown USA," Allison Park, Pennsylvania","With energy conservation and minimal maintenance as one of the client’s top priorities, RSSC used concrete masonry, metal siding and glass paneled overhead doors to create the building’s exterior. Large continuous skylights provide natural light to reduce energy consumption and costs, while a hi-tech water reclamation system reduces the amount of fresh water consumed to one-fifth of the amount of a typical automated car wash."

Western Pennsylvania Humane Society," Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","The carefully planned layout separates public from private areas, yet allows visitors, staff and volunteers to maneuver the 24,000 square-foot facility with ease. The holding kennel and cattery allows staff to provide medical care, socialization and training to animals prior to being moved into the adoption area. Furthering their “Open Door” mission, the expanded animal clinic provides low-cost outpatient care, routine examinations and vaccinations for the community, while the Education Department features a 3,000 square-foot training room."

Pittsburgh Veterinary Specialty & Emergency Center," Washington, Pennsylvania","The newly built PVSEC-South Veterinary facility required a sophisticated design and layout to encompass all of the specialty patient needs in one center. Because the client required a facility where physicians share spaces, logical flow patterns were designed to create streamlined mobility for multiple specialists tending to various patients. These flow patterns promote organization and order among the doctors and guests, including public and private entrances, and separate check-in-and-out areas for pet owners and pets. Complex heating, cooling, and ventilation systems were installed to provide an environment without the threat of cross contamination. Additionally, the strategic use of natural light helps conserve energy and provides guest with a warm, inviting atmosphere."
City Mission," Washington, Pennsylvania","Committed to our client, we wanted to help them rebuild and continue to provide their important and often life changing services, so we assisted the City Mission with the necessary paperwork to apply for a Federal Home Loan Bank grant. With our assistance and the help of others, City Mission received a $1.5 million grant to assist with their rebuilding process."

Yerecic Label Company," New Kensington, Pennsylvania","RSSC Architecture’s design took advantage of the building’s site and orientation. With a direct view from the road, the 6,800 square-foot brick office building and front plaza with sign wall provide maximum exposure. With a direct view from the administrative area, staff members can see the beautiful nearby pond. Beyond the brick office area, a pre-engineered structure was constructed to create an open-floor production facility that could be expanded in the future. Once implemented, the design provided Yerecic Label Company with their goal of growing their business. They approached RSSC Architecture for a second time: To expand their manufacturing facility, becoming a repeat client."

Wexford Vol. Fire Company," Wexford, Pennsylvania","The facility has a training tower for hands-on, real life scenario exercises that includes a functional standpipe, an area for repelling and confined space entry. Another important safety and efficiency feature is the use of bi-fold garage doors and drive through truck bays that decrease response times and provide easier flow of the equipment and vehicles when the fire engines and trucks return to station."
